# Covid-19-CXR-Image-Translations-using-GAN-s
This is a recent project ,in which I worked on Image 2 Image Translations using a Cycle GAN network. 

Plan -: I take input of a normal chest x ray image and then translate it to produce a fake realisitic looking COVID-19 X-Ray image..
The purpose of this project is mainly to create a better COVID-19 Chest X Ray dataset that could be used for a wide variety of purposes.
