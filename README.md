# Covid-19-CXR-Image-Translations-using-GAN-s
This is my current minor project, in which I am working on Image to Image Translation using GAN's(Generative Adversarial Networks)  for Covid-19 CXR Images.
I take input of a normal chest x ray image and then translate it to produce a fake realisitic looking COVID-19 X-Ray image..
The purpose of this project is mainly to create a better COVID-19 Chest X Ray dataset that could be used for a wide variety of purposes.

There could be many other application's of this model as well such as how closely the image of the current X-Ray matches to the COVID-19 X-Ray image generated.

Eventually my goal is to create an entire Covid-19 tool which would be very beneficial to the society.
